People to be in a vehicle with others in their group
Never want Male driving all females
Minibus needs second leader in
Fewer cars the better - preferably no one using the middle seat
Better for leaders to go with their group

Want to give first years preference
Want to give people a mix over the week - ie people who have been disappointed

------
- Prefer 2 from each group over 3 and 1 (excluding leader)
    - Don't have one boy in girls car and vice-versa
- See Shrives and Jenkins
- Better to have more cars if we get more whole group together
    - Whole group bonus (+ driven by one of their leaders) 
    - Maximizing your smallest groups (3:1 -> 1, 2:2 -> 2, 4:0 -> 4)
- Everyone starts on 15: lose 3 for 1st choice, lose 2 for 2nd choice
- 1st choice is key. Happy to seperate groups if they all have 1st choices
- 3rd choice with rest of dorm beats 2nd choice with no one on their group
- 4 people from same group -> better to have either all 4 or 0 -> Avoid 2nd 2
- Don't want 5 to be 3 and 2
- 2 from same dorm -> Wou;dn't do 1 and 1
- 3 from same dorm > Wouldn't do 2 and 1
- Only way to be the only one in your dorm on an activity is if you are the only one in the dorm who put as first choice.
- No one else in their dorm has been allocated to their 2nd and 3rd choice
- If rest of dorm is on football, basically the other person has to not even select football as 3rd
